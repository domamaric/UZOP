## Project overveiw :mag:

The course of the project through three phases:
 - First: Preparation and visualization of Kaggle dataset
 - Second: Preparation and visualization of scientific article
 - Third: Replicating and improving the results

### Fisrt Part

The goal of this part of the project is to implement data preparation methods that are processed in lectures and auditory exercises on a certain tabular data that the assistant selected from Kaggle.


### Second Part

The goal of this part of the project is to familiarize yourself with the data from the scientific article. It is recommended to read the selected article and download the data that was used. After that, you need to familiarize yourself with the data.

### Third Part

Final part of the project, first use the approaches from the selected article to replicate the presented results. During the actual implementation, use already implemented functions from packages such as `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, etc. Once the methods are implemented, it is necessary to run them on previously prepared data, correctly evaluate them, compare them with the results from the article and explain any differences.

## Notes :memo:

Project is done using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
